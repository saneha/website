              <h3>Decommissioning</h3>
              <p>An important part of the decommissioning process is the removal of sensitive data from hard drives or media that contain that data. To ensure integrity of this service we have, from time to time, engaged specialist forensic analysts to conduct internal auditing of our processes. We also engage the services of a major International Corporate to conduct monthly security audits on our facility and processes.<br>

Part of this audit involves randomly selecting equipment that has been security wiped and subjecting this equipment to a forensic program to try and recover data. This means our processing is constantly subject to scrutiny and has passed every time.<br><br>
The results of this monitoring has meant we are extremely confident in our security wiping services. We believe our decommissioning processes are among the best in the World. In fact a major financial institution after rating us against others in our industry rated us "Number One!".<br><br>
Remarkit also have in-house shredders and hydraulic crusher to deal with any equipment containing sensitive data that cannot be security wiped effectively.

              <h3>Recycling</h3>
              <p>New Zealand is focusing more and more on the need to recycle electronic (e-waste) in an environmentally friendly way.

<h2>Remarkit is a ISO14001 certified company!</h2>

Remarkit have been at the forefront of the e-waste recycling industry for many years. Remarkit have not only been an organisation that champions the need for sustainability but have been pioneers in finding innovative solutions to this growing problem.<br><br>
Remarkit initiated funding from the Government to do the first ever e-waste study in New Zealand. We were the first to apply for a Basel Permit to ship CRT Monitors offshore for disposal in an eco friendly way. We were at the forefront of initiating and organising the first ever New Zealand e-Day where consumers were able to dispose of their computer waste for free. This helped to inspire a nation which has resulted in many other organisations like ours, Councils and Corporates being involved in running e-Days in other parts of New Zealand.<br><br>
Through our National and International Network we can organise the disposal of most IT waste, aiming at diverting in the area of 98% from Landfill. Much has been made of the pollutants that exist in obsolete IT equipment. For example a CRT monitor can contain up to 3Kg of lead, this poses a serious health hazard if the monitor is just dumped in a landfill, the lead could leach into the soil and contaminate it.<br><br>
The best way to dispose of equipment is to recycle it back into a "useful life", sometimes referred to as re-purposing. There are many groups, small business, schools and end users that find great value in second-hand equipment. As we reuse equipment it becomes useful right through its intended life which can add 5 or 6 years to its lifes. Rather than equipment sitting in rooms with its value decreasing daily or dumped in landfills, it's better to get the equipment back into a situation of usefulness.</p>
